0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s); FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s); FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Prototype: int factorial(int n); If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error Factorial of 0 is 1

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y); If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1 FYI: The standard library provides a different function: pow. Run man pow to learn more.

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n); If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1 FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more.

6. Inception. Is it possible?
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(char *s); An empty string is a palindrome
